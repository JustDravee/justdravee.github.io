GM! or HM! (iykyk)

I'm Dravee. You may've seen me here and there. I identify as a deep-blue dinosaur... somehow.

I'm a Lead Security Researcher at Certora and also a Scout & Judge on code4rena.

Have you noticed how auditing is so incredibly hard?  

The breadth of knowledge you need is immense, and the skill to apply it effectively is even harder to grasp. 

Plateauing is quite common and staying stuck at the junior level for years may happen.

Here, I share practical advice, hard-earned insights, and lessons from my own journey as a security researcher. 

Perhaps this could help you.

Good luck in your own journey!

Dravee
